tutorials, demos, and other documentation for rendering in Smash Ultimate can be accessed from the navigation menu.\nMany of these pages contain interactive demos using WebGL, which should work on most computers, phones, and tablets. The Col, PRM, and NOR texture pages are a good starting point. Click the search icon to search any of the pages on this site.\nThe main Github repository contains documentation pages that serve as quick references for material parameters, texture types, etc. The documentation pages are updated more frequently than the website but contain less detailed explanations. \nConventions&nbsp;\nThe terms \"texture\" and \"map\" both refer to the images used to color a model to adjust its shading. The term \"texture\" is the technical term used for programming 3D and 2D graphics. The term \"map\" is usually combined with a specific usage of a texture like \"albedo map\" or \"ambient occlusion map\". The guides use both terms interchangeably. \nRGB colors can use integer values like 255, 0, 128 or floating point values like 1.0, 0.0, 0.5. Textures typically only allow values between 0 and 255, which converts to a floating point range of 0.0 to 1.0.\nCustomVector parameters have 4 parameter values. These values are floating point numbers like 0.0, -200.4, or 1.3333. \nThe 4 values will be referred to as XYZW or RGBA. For example, CustomVector11.g and CustomVector11.y both refer to the second value for CustomVector11. CustomVector11.w and CustomVector11.a both refer to the fourth value. Values can be written as (r, g, b, a) or (x, y, z,w ). Mixing and matching representations in the same context will be avoided where possible. \nThe four values of a texture can also be written using the \"texture.b\" or \"texture.z\" notation depending on if it makes more sense to refer to the channels as RGBA colors or not. Phrases like \"PRM alpha\", \"PRM.a\" or \"PRM.w\" all refer to the fourth channel of the PRM texture. Not all alpha channels are used for transparency, but the convention in image editing programs is to show the fourth channel as alpha regardless of its usage.\nTools&nbsp;\n\nSSBH Editor - view, edit, and validate models\nssbh_lib_json/ssbh_data_json - command line tools for editing model formats as text files\nsmash-ultimate-blender - import and export models with Blender\nSwitch Toolbox - edit bntx and nutexb files (Windows only)\nUltimate Tex - batch convert texture files like bntx, dds, or nutexb\nSmush LUT - edit color_grading_lut.nutexb files\n\nSupport&nbsp;\nReport any bugs in issues if one of the links is broken or a page isn't rendering correctly.\nCredits&nbsp;\n\nthree.js - WebGL rendering library\nZola - static site generator\nbook - theme used to style this site\n\n","id":"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/introduction/","title":"Introduction"},"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/materials/":{"body":"Models are rendered on the GPU using compiled programs called shaders. Shaders take multiple inputs such as \ntextures, geometry, lighting data, and other visual parameters to calculate the rendered color or \"shading\" for an object on screen. \nThe materials contained in the model.numatb helps determine some of the inputs passed to the shader program for drawing. The additional inputs for drawing come from the mesh parameters and other rendering configuration files. The required inputs for a shader program are hardcoded into the program code, so it is important that the material correctly specifies all the inputs needed by the shader listed in the shader label field of the material. Applications like SSBH Editor will give warnings if the material does not specify all required inputs for the shader.\nMaterials are assigned to meshes in a model using the model.numdlb file. Each mesh can only have one material active at a time, but each material can be assigned to any number of meshes. Some special effects like the ditto transformation use additional material files like metamon_model.numatb. The game will skip rendering any meshes that don't have a material assigned, which can be used to make a mesh invisible.\nEditing Materials&nbsp;\nThe easiest way to edit materials is using SSBH Editor's Matl Editor. The Matl Editor in SSBH Editor gives realtime feedback in the viewport for how most material edits will look in game. SSBH Editor also has additional features for improving the editing experience like saving and applying material presets and checking for common errors during editing.\nMaterials can also be edited using ssbh_lib_json or ssbh_data_json. Both programs are commandline programs that convert numatb files to and from JSON. JSON is a text format and can be edited in any text editor like notepad++, VSCode, etc. Simply drag the numatb file onto the executable, edit the JSON, and drag the JSON onto the executable to make a new numatb. If no file appears in any of these steps, try running the program from command prompt to check the error output. ssbh_data_json is generally recommended over ssbh_lib_json since ssbh_data_json uses a more concise and readable format. Both programs are available for Windows on the ssbh_lib releases.\nFor writing Python scripts to edit materials, see ssbh_data_py.\n","id":"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/materials/","title":"Materials"},"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/materials/hair-materials/":{"body":"Hair materials have separate parameters to control specular highlights to better recreate the way light interacts with hair.

The transitions happen quite quickly, so it's easy to miss the effect during normal gameplay. \nExamples of material transitions include inkling's ink or the metal box item. An animated threshold value combined with the model's NOR map blue channel \nenables models to smoothly transition between two completely different materials.

A NOR map blue channel value of 0.0 would transition instantly, a value of 0.5 would take later to transition, and a value of 1.0 takes the longest to transition to the transition material. As the threshold value approaches 0.0, the transition is reversed with the brightest regions of the NOR map blue channel being the last regions of the model to return to the normal material. \nMaterials are blended together by blending their input parameters rather than blending the final colors for both materials. \nBlending the input parameters is generally more efficient because the model only has to be rendered once rather than rendering with each material separately and blending the results.\n// Calculate the blending factor between the original and transition material.\nfloat transitionBlend = 0.0;\nif (norColor.b &gt;= (1.0 - threshold)) {\n    transitionBlend = 1.0;\n}\n// Blend the relevant shading parameters. \nshadingParameter = mix(originalParameter, transitionMaterialParameter, transitionBlend);\n\nTransition Materials - WIP&nbsp;\nInkling's Ink&nbsp;\nMetal Box&nbsp;\nGold (Xerneas)&nbsp;\nDitto&nbsp;\nCreating Transition Blend Maps - WIP&nbsp;\n\n","id":"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/materials/material-transitions/","title":"Material Transitions"},"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/materials/model-brightness/":{"body":"Custom models in Smash Ultimate often appear brighter than expected. \nThis page explains the main sources of overly bright models and potential fixes.\nAlbedo Color&nbsp;\nExplanation&nbsp;\n\n    \n    Note how the model appears brighter than the col map's color in the shaded squares.\n\nThe model's col maps determine its overall albedo or base color. The albedo color stored in the col map determines how much red, green, and blue light a model reflects rather than the final color that appears on screen. For example, an albedo brightness of 50% with a lighting intensity of 2.0 will have the same apparent brightness on screen as an albedo brightness of 100% with a lighting intensity of 1.0. In general, col map colors with 70% brightness will appear fully white on most stages. The wikipedia albedo page has a diagram with common real world albedo values that also tend to work well in Smash Ultimate. Real world example of surfaces that reflect approximately 70% of incoming light are paper and some white paints.\nFixes&nbsp;\nThe final brightness in game will vary depending on the stage's lighting. As a general rule, take the desired color on screen and reduce the brightness to 70% of the original.  For example, a model that should appear solid white (255,255,255) on screen should actually be closer to (180,180,180) in the col map.  An easy way to lower the texture brightness is to use a levels adjustment in an image editor. Lower the output brightness until the brightest part of the texture is below 70% brightness.\nThe albedo color brightness can also be controlled by material editing CustomVector13. Setting the RGB values between 0.0 and 1.0 will darken \nthe albedo color without needing to edit any textures. If the brightest value in the col map has a brightness of 100%, setting CustomVector13 to roughly (0.70, 0.70, 0.70, 1.0) will likely eliminate most of the blooming. \nSpecular Highlights&nbsp;\nExplanation&nbsp;\n\n    \n    Different PRM (metalness, roughness, ambient occlusion, specular) values with ambient occlusion left unchanged.\n\nSpecular reflections are another common source of overly bright models and are the hardest to control. \nSpecular reflections in Smash Ultimate try to be energy conserving, meaning that objects never reflect more light than they receive. \nSpecular highlights appear darker as the roughness increases since the same amount of light is reflected from a larger area. \nDecreasing roughness focuses the specular highlight, making it appear brighter.\nThe GGX function used for specular in Smash Ultimate is prone to having bright highlights, especially for metallic materials with low roughness values. This clipping in bright regions occurs even without bloom. This effect is easiest to see in the PRM demo, which doesn't contain any post processing. \nFixing Metallic Materials&nbsp;\nMetallic materials use the albedo color from the col map as the specular color. Col maps are often much brighter than the recommended specular value of 0.16. Lowering the metalness will use a blend of the col map and PRM alpha channel, which can produce darker but less saturated highlights. \nThe decrease in apparent saturation from lowering metalness may not always be desired. The only reliable way to produce saturated highlights without the risk of being too bright is to increase roughness. Roughness values above 0.7 are unlikely to cause clipping such as in the comparison of Samus above.\nFixing Non Metallic Materials&nbsp;\nThe most common cause of overly bright highlights for non metallic materials is setting the specular map brightness too high. The PRM alpha channel is scaled differently than many other PBR applications and games, so a reasonable starting value is 0.16 or lower. See the PRM page for details. Increasing roughness can also make non metallic specular appear darker but tends to be less of an issue than for metallic materials.\nVertex Color&nbsp;\nExplanation&nbsp;\nVertex color attributes in Smash Ultimate are scaled during rendering. A colorSet1 value of (0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5) will render as white in game since colorSet1 is scaled by a factor of 2.0. For a full list of scaling values, see Vertex Attributes. Different exporting applications will handle vertex color scaling differently, which may result in models rendering as brighter than intended.\nFixes&nbsp;\nThe render settings menu for SSBH Editor has various render modes and toggles for vertex color. If the model appears too bright with vertex color rendering enabled, check the color set debug modes like colorSet1. Unchecking the vertex color scaling will show the raw color values. For example, colorSet1 values should usually not exceed (0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5) with scaling unchecked for most models. The actual values on screen may differ slightly due to gamma correction. Vertex color scaling should be fixed in the 3d modeling program used to export such as Blender.\n","id":"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/materials/model-brightness/","title":"Model Brightness"},"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/materials/renormal/":{"body":"A small number of materials in game have material labels that begin with the \"RENORMAL_\" prefix like \"RENORMAL_skin_pikachu_001\".

There's no need to premultiply the nutexb texture in this case.\nPremultiplied Alpha&nbsp;\nAlpha blending works by mixing the source color with the destination color using the alpha of the source color. In some rare cases the alpha of the destination color or background color is used as well. The multiplication of the source or foreground alpha can be baked into the source color (premultiplied) or calculated later (postmultiplied or \"straight\" alpha). Using premultiplied alpha generally produces better results in more cases. \nSee the Nvidia documentation or gamedev StackExchange for more information.\n// Postmultiplied or Straight Alpha\ndestinationColor.rgb = (sourceColor.rgb * sourceColor.a) + (destinationColor.rgb * (1.0 - sourceColor.a));\n\n// Premultiplied Alpha\ndestinationColor.rgb = (sourceColor.rgb * 1.0) + (destinationColor.rgb * (1.0 - sourceColor.a));\n\nIt's important to note that some shaders in Smash Ultimate premultiply the rendered color by the calculated alpha value. In this case, it is usually unecessary to premultiply the input textures themselves. Whether a shader premultiplies the rendered color or not is hardcoded and difficult to determine at this time. These shaders usually use blend state factors of \"One\" and \"OneMinusSourceAlpha\". These are the same blend factors required to make premultiplied alpha work when premultiplying the RGB color of the nutexb texture for a shader that does premultiply the calculated shader alpha.\nAlpha Testing&nbsp;\n\n    \n    \n    Opaque Pass (no alpha test)\n    \n    Alpha\n    \n    Combined\n\nAlpha testing skips rendering any pixels that have an alpha value less than a certain threshold. The texture's alpha channel acts as a mask to \"cut out\" transparent regions of the model. This avoids the sorting issues with alpha blending but can only be used for making regions of a model completely opaque or completely transparent. This works well for hair, leaves, or other materials that would \nhave significant sorting issues with alpha blending and don't require being partially transparent. \nThe above image shows examples of alpha testing on the Battlefield stage. Note that leaves are in the opaque pass despite having transparency. \nThis is fine since alpha testing doesn't depend on render order like alpha blending. With alpha testing disabled in the shaders, the leaves render the same as other opaque meshes. \nThe combined result shows the final rendered image with alpha testing enabled and post processing applied.\nAlpha testing is hardcoded into certain shaders with a threshold of 0.5. Adjusting the first value of \nCustomVector0 to 1.0 effectively disables alpha testing because the texture alpha will be clamped to 1.0. \n// Don't render any pixels with texture alpha less than 0.5.\n// The texture alpha is usually from the col map.\nfloat alpha = max(texture.a, CustomVector0.x);\nif (alpha &lt; 0.5)\n    discard;\n\nAlpha Sample to Coverage&nbsp;\n\n    \n    An example of alpha sample to coverage for ZSS's hair. Note the pixelated dithering patterns.\n\nAlpha blending provides smooth blending but is prone to sorting issues. Alpha testing doesn't have any sorting issues but can only render parts of a model as fully opaque or fully transparent. Alpha sample to coverage represents transparency by sampling fragments or pixels based on their alpha.\nA 50% transparent white surface and a 50% black surface with normal alpha blending will produce the expected result of gray. \nAlpha testing will only display one of the surfaces due to the alpha threshold that is applied. \nAlpha sample to coverage will render roughly 50% of the pixels as black and roughly 50% of the pixels as white. \nFrom a distance, the overall effect is a surface that looks roughly gray. \nLike alpha testing, this effect doesn't have any sorting issues but can look noticeably grainy due to the game only rendering at 1080p.\nAlpha sample to coverage works best for translucent surfaces with lots of intersections that won't work well with other techniques like hair modeled with lots of 2D planes. Many games use a similar technique for LOD transitions or hiding objects blocking the camera. It's cheaper to render than alpha blending and creates a smoother transition than simply toggling the visibility.\nRender Order&nbsp;\nLike layers in Photoshop, the render order for meshes matters for alpha blending to work correctly. \nAlpha testing and alpha sample to coverage are order independent and don't require a specific render order.\nOpaque meshes should use the _opaque pass to be rendered first. \nMeshes with alpha blending should use _far or _sort to ensure they layer on top of the opaque meshes.\nThe _near render pass tag is a special case for transparent meshes that should render without any bloom applied.\nThe order in which different meshes for a model are rendered depends on the shader label. The tag at the end of the shader label \nsplits the meshes into different rendering passes. For example, all meshes with \"_far\" will render before any meshes with \"_sort\" \nregardless of the parent model. In general, meshes with alpha blending should use \"_sort\", and all other meshes should use \"_opaque\".\n\n_opaque\n_far\n_sort\nbloom pass\n_near\ncolor grading pass\n\n","id":"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/materials/transparency/","title":"Transparency"},"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/post_processing/":{"body":"\n\n    \n    From left to right: the base image, the bloom contribution, the image after adding bloom, and the final image after applying the color grading LUT.\n\nSmash Ultimate contains several post processing steps that grealy impact the final look of the image after all the models and effects are rendered.

Compressed textures in Smash Ultimate use \nthe same compression as DDS files. Textures can do more than control the color of a model and enable a variety of effects in game liked baked lighting and shadows, environment reflections, and color grading. Most textures are 2D textures and depend on a model's texture coordinates to map the 2D textures to the 3D geometry of the model.\nTexture Names&nbsp;\nTexture names in Smash Ultimate are paths to the texture file. All model textures are stored in .nutexb files, so the file extension is omitted. A texture name like \"def_mario_001_col\" refers to the file \"def_mario_001_col.nutexb\" in the model's folder. The string value stored in the .numatb file is the corresponding texture's file name with no extension. This can be a file in the current directory like asf_ashley_col or a full path like /common/shader/sfxPBS/default_Params. Cube map textures can specify #replace_cubemap to use the current stage's reflection cube map.\nDefault Textures&nbsp;\nAny material can reference default textures stored in the /common/shader directories. Note that the red and yellow checkerboards that appear for invalid models are rendered in screen space using shaders and don't use any textures. For a full list of default textures, see Default Textures.\nEditing Textures&nbsp;\nIn game texture files are stored in a memory layout optimized for the Switch using a process called \"swizzling\" and must be converted using dedicated tools before the textures can be edited and viewed on a computer. Most textures in Smash Ultimate are also compressed using compression formats like BC7 or BC6. These formats are identical to the formats used for DDS files and can be edited using standalone tools or image editor plugins. \nNot all programs that edit DDS files support more modern formats like BC7. Textures can be easily converted to a variety of formats on Windows, Linux, or MacOS using Ultimate Tex. Converting nutexb textures to PNG or TIFF will allow easier editing in more programs.\n","id":"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/textures/","title":"Textures"},"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/textures/col/":{"body":"Col maps control the albedo of a model. Albedo is the overall color of an object. Surfaces with higher albedo reflect more light and appear brighter than surfaces with \nlow albedo. This corresponds to the base color input of Blender's Principled Shader. This is the primary texture to edit when recoloring a model. PRM and NOR maps can greatly improve the quality of a\nmodel, but they aren't strictly necessary.\nCol Map Channels&nbsp;\nCol maps contain color data, so they should be saved with sRGB formats. sRGB formats have names that end in _SRGB.\nWhen rendering in programs such as Maya or Blender, set the Col maps to Color, sRGB, etc to ensure they are properly\ngamma corrected. Failing to use an sRGB format will result in the textures being too bright and looking washed out.\nAlbedo/Base Color (RGB)&nbsp;\n\nUnlike diffuse maps, albedo maps don't contain any baked lighting or shadows. This means most models in game \nwill have albedo maps that are mostly solid colors. Details are typically baked into the NOR and PRM maps. \nAvoid using col map values close to pure white (255,255,255) or pure black (0,0,0). Use col map values below \n0.72 (180 RGB) to avoid overly bright models and unwanted glow. A col map set to (180,180,180) will look grey in Photoshop but appear \nalmost completely white in game. The Post Processing Passes page contains more details on why this happens. \nThe Albedo Recoloring, PRM, and Skin Materials pages all have demos that demonstrate the effects of editing the model's albedo color.\nOpacity (Alpha)&nbsp;\nThe alpha channel of the col map controls the opacity of the model. A value of 0.0 is completely transparent, and a value of 1.0 is completely opaque. Values in between 0.0 and 1.0 create a partially transparent effect. Not all materials have alpha blending enabled.

This results in noticeable visual quality loss compared to using an sRGB format. The blocky regions of identical pixel values are more easily compressed, so the final compressed file size is smaller. There is no change in the image file size before compression. UI textures should be saved using SRGB unless the compressed size needs to match the original file's compressed size. \nAvoid trying to \"fix\" the texture gamma manually in an image editor. The inverse sRGB adjustment applied before the final color is displayed on screen is not the same as \na gamma adjustment of (1.0 / 2.2), so the final color will not be correct if the texture was darkened using a gamma of 2.2 and saved as unorm. \nThe result after applying a gamma or levels adjustment is still only stored using 8 bits per color channel, which produces noticeable banding artifacts in game such as in the above image. The artifacts caused by manually gamma correcting textures but saving as a linear format is most noticeable in darker tones on compressed textures.\nSaving the texture using an sRGB format performs the correct gamma conversion using floating point and won't introduce any noticeable quality loss.\nTexture Formats&nbsp;\nThe texture's format tells the game how to interpret the texture's data for use in the shaders. The format should match the type of data stored in the texture and it's intended usage. \nChanging the format modifier at the end of the format name such as \"BC7_SRGB\" vs \"BC7_UNORM\" just indicates how to convert the texture values to float and does not change the texture data or file size.\nThe process of converting the integer values to floating point is called normalization. \nSee the OpenGL wiki's normalized integer page for technical details. \nTextures need to be saved with the correct format to appear correctly in game. Saving with the wrong format will result in the texture appearing \ntoo bright or too dark in game. The full format depends on the compression type being used and if the texture has alpha. \nsRGB&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTextures with sRGB formats store nonlinear color data. The texture values are converted to linear floating point values in the range 0.0 to 1.0 using the \nsRGB transfer function. \nThe conversion from the sRGB texture values directly to floating point doesn't introduce any of the artifacts caused by applying the adjustment manually in an image editor.\nSmash Ultimate uses the sRGB format for storing the final color to be displayed on screen, \nso textures storing color data should also use a format with \"sRGB\" as part of the format name.\nUnorm (Unsigned Normalized / Linear / Linear Unsigned)&nbsp;\n\n\nTextures with unorm formats store linear data and are converted to floating point by simply dividing by the type's max value. \n8 bit values are divided by 255, 16 bit values are divided by 16355, etc. This converts unsigned integer values to floating point values in the range 0.0 to 1.0. \nTextures that don't store color data, such as NOR maps and PRM maps, must be saved as unorm to render correctly in game.\nSnorm (Signed Normalized / Linear Signed)&nbsp;\n\n\nTextures with snorm formats are converted to floating point values in the range -1.0 to 1.0.

When rendering in programs such as Maya or Blender, set the PRM\nmaps to raw, non color data, or linear to ensure\nthe values aren't gamma corrected.\nMetalness (Red)&nbsp;\n\nMetalness determines whether a surface is metallic or not and affects both specular and diffuse shading.\nIn general, materials should be either fully metallic (1.0) or non metallic (0.0).\nValues in between 0.0 and 1.0 enable smoother blending between metallic and non metallic regions of a model.\nNon metals have a white specular color and the diffuse component is colored by the albedo.\nThe specular intensity for non metals is controlled by the PRM's specular. Metals have no diffuse component\nand specular intensity is controlled entirely by albedo. In the demo above, note how the specular highlight becomes\ncloser in color to the albedo color as metalness increases.\nSkin materials are a special case and instead use the metalness map as a mask for the fake subsurface scattering effect. \nSee the Skin Materials page for details.\nRoughness (Green)&nbsp;\n\nRoughness affects the size of the specular highlight. Rougher surfaces have larger specular highlights than glossy\nsurfaces.\nThe environment reflections will look blurrier for larger roughness values for both metals and non metals.\nThis is achieved using a cube map and mipmapping. Higher roughness values use smaller mipmaps,\nresulting in more even specular lighting. In the demo above, set metalness to 1.0 and experiment with different\nroughness values.\nPhysically based surfaces shouldn't reflect more light than they receive, so larger roughness values make the specular\nhighlight darker to preserve the overall amount of light being reflected. A rough, matte screen, for example, has reflections \nthat are much darker than a glossy screen. Compare roughness values of 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 in the demo above to see \nthe changes in both the size and brightness of the specular highlight.\nAmbient Occlusion (Blue)&nbsp;\n\nAmbient occlusion maps are a baked approximation of shadows. The \"ambient\" refers to the soft lighting from the environment such as reflected light from the walls of a room or the sky. \nThe \"occlusion\" refers to the darkening effect when light is \"occluded\" or blocked from reaching the surface. Cracks, crevices, and the corners of walls appear darker than the surrounding surface due to \nself shadowing that would be difficult to achieve with realtime shadows. Ambient occlusion maps improves the realism of the model by reducing unwanted ambient diffuse lighting and specular reflections\nin certain areas like the backside of a cape or the roof of a character's mouth.\nAmbient occlusion affects the intensity of specular and diffuse ambient lighting. In the demo above, note the\ndifferences between setting ambient occlusion to 0.0 for metallic and non metallic materials. Setting ambient occlusion to white\n(1.0) has no effect.\nSpecular (Alpha)&nbsp;\n\nSpecular controls the base specular reflectivity of a surface. This effects the intensity of specular highlights and \ncube map reflections. The reflectivity always approaches 1.0 at glancing angles. Specular is scaled by 0.2, so a specular value of 0.5 \nresults in a specular reflectivity of 0.1. A reasonable starting value for specular is 0.16 (40 in RGB) to avoid overly bright highlights. \n\n    \n    Note how the reflection in the glass is brightest when the camera is parallel with the glass.\n\nSurfaces in the real world exhibit something called the fresnel effect (pronounced \"fre-nel\") where the reflectivity \nof the surface depends on the angle between the orientation of the surface and the viewing direction. \nThe effect is easiest to see on flat, glossy surfaces such as water or glass. In the below image of Mario, the edges \nof the model always have reflectance values close to 1.0 regardless of the base specular value from the PRM alpha. \n\n    \n    The specular reflectance for different PRM specular values. The buttons are not affected by specular since their metalness is 1.0. Note how the edges are always 100% reflective.\n\nMetals work differently and use the albedo color from the col map as the specular reflectivity. This allows for specular to be \ntinted by the albedo color. Specular reflectivity is not scaled by 0.2 for metals, so metals can be significantly more reflective.\nA metalness of 1.0 will ignore the specular map entirely and use the col map color to control specular intensity.\nPRM Compatibility Details&nbsp;\nPBR textures are rendered slightly differently in different games and applications, so models will look\nslightly different when PRM maps are used in Blender Cycles or Unreal Engine, for example. This section covers the\nnecessary technical details for accurately adapting PRM maps to work in other sources or adapting PBR textures from\nother sources to work similarly in Smash Ultimate.\nConverting Metalness&nbsp;\nPRM metalness maps are generally compatible between different games and applications. Some applications use separate\nmaterials\nfor metals like gold or chrome and non metals. In that case, assume anything with a PRM metalness close to 1.0 is fully\nmetallic.\nMetalness values between 0.0 and 1.0 in Smash Ultimate are often used to tint the specular color using the albedo color.\nA similar effect can be achieved by using a non metallic material and tinting the specular color directly. This is\ncalled \"Specular Tint\" in Blender's Principled\nShader.\nSkin materials in Smash Ultimate are a special case in that they aren't actually metallic. Metalness should be set to\n0.0 or use a\nstandard non metallic material and use the PRM metalness map to control subsurface scattering intensity. Similarly,\nmaps that mask subsurface scattering can be used as a metalness maps for skin materials in Smash Ultimate.\nConverting Roughness&nbsp;\nSmash Ultimate squares its roughness values, which is common in other PBR renderers. Use this page as a reference to\nmatch roughness values between Smash Ultimate\nand other PBR textures. Roughness has values between 0.0 and 1.0, so squaring has the biggest impact on on values closer\nto 0.0.\nThis has the effect of making smooth surfaces much smoother. Squaring roughness can be done in an image editor using a\ngamma adjustment of 2.0.\nSimilarly, taking the square root of roughness is a gamma adjustment of 0.5.\nSmash Ultimate clamps roughness values to 0.01 to avoid dividing by 0.0 in the shader. Roughness of 0.0 is a special\ncase that may be handled differently by different applications.\nIn general, try to use roughness values close to 0.01 instead of 0.0 for extremely smooth surfaces.\nConverting Ambient Occlusion&nbsp;\nAmbient occlusion can be baked and/or painted by hand. Some games have very dark ambient occlusion maps that may not\nwork well with Smash Ultimate's lighting.\nIn that case, the original ambient occlusion map can be rebaked, adjusted to be lighter, or set to white (1.0) if the\nadded contrast and depth to shading isn't required.\nSome physically based renderers such as Blender Cycles don't have shader inputs for ambient occlusion.\nThe shadowing effect of ambient occlusion is already simulated by the simulation of light rays in the scene.\nIf the PRM ambient occlusion map contains detail not present in the model's geometry (scales, fur, etc), the albedo\ncolor can be multiplied by the\nambient occlusion to achieve a similar effect.\nConverting Specular&nbsp;\nSpecular defines the reflectance at normal.

Note how smaller mipmaps have a special \"blur\" effect.\n\nUnlike normal cube map textures, specular cube maps have mipmaps. The mipmaps simulate the \nappearance of environment reflections at different roughness levels. Stage cube maps are typically \n64x64 pixels. The base mipmap is the full 64x64 pixels and corresponds to the detailed reflections for a roughness of 0.. \nThe last mipmap has a size of 1x1 and simulates the blurry reflections for a roughness of 1.0. Roughness values in between 0 and 1 \nblend between mip levels to create appropriately detailed or blurry reflections. \nThe actual conversion from PRM roughness to the mip level accessed from the cube map is shown below.\nThis creates a smooth curve from the base mipmap at a roughness of 0.0 to the smallest mipmap at a roughness of 1.0.\nfloat RoughnessToLod(float roughness) {\n    // Applies a curves adjustment to roughness.\n    // Clamp roughness to avoid divide by 0.\n    float r = max(roughness, 0.01);\n    float r2 = r * r;\n    return log2((1.0 / r2) * 2.0 - 2.0) * -0.4545 + 4.0;\n}\n\nHDR Texture Formats&nbsp;\n\n    \n    \n    SDR\n    \n    HDR Floating Point\n\nFor best results, specular cube maps should use floating point formats like BC6UFloat since they can encode HDR (high dynamic range) lighting data. \nThis gives improved lighting quality when used with PBR materials like in Smash Ultimate. Floating point cube maps can achieve similar quality to an HDRI in Maya or Blender. Specular cube maps in Smash Ultimate do not affect diffuse lighting, however. Note the more vivid reflections in the armor in the demo above when using an HDR format that supports colors brighter than 1.0.\nCreating Specular Cube Maps - WIP&nbsp;\nThe base mip level can be baked using traditional methods for creating cube maps. \nThe mip levels should be not created by hand and must be generated by an appropriate tool to create accurate results.\nLimitations&nbsp;\nMaterials in Smash Ultimate can only reference a single stage specific cube map at a time using the \"#replace_cubemap\" value. \nThis means the lighting will only be correct for the single point in space used to bake the cube map. Stage models can use \ntheir own model specific cube maps to improve the accuracy of the reflections. This doesn't benefit models that appear on multiple stages like fighters or items.\nThe floating point format used for HDR lighting improves lighting quality at the cost of greatly increased file sizes. Attempting to increase the cube map size beyond 64x64 may cause memory and stability issues in graphically demanding scenarios. Note that cube map resolution mostly affects materials with low roughness values, since rough surfaces will use higher mip levels with smaller dimensions.\n","id":"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/textures/specularcube/","title":"Specular Cube (Texture7)"},"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/vertex_attributes/":{"body":"Vertices in Smash Ultimate contain multiple attributes.

The Vertex Attribute page on the main repository contains a table of color set attributes and their scale values.\nWhether or not the mesh's color set attribute data is used depends on the shader.

The rock and grass textures in this example are tiled numerous times, so it's not possible to specify an appropriate mask for the grassy regions using the texture alpha. colorSet5 has alpha values of roughly 0.3333 for the areas that should use the grass layer. The vertex color values are interpolated between adjacent vertices, which softens the transitions between textures.

These vectors often contain floating point values that can't be directly displayed as a color like negative numbers. One approach to visualize vertex normals like in the screenshot above is to scale the XYZ values into the 0.0 to 1.0 range and interpret the XYZ values as RGB colors. Surfaces that point up have a positive Y component and display as green. Surfaces the point right have a positive X component and display as red. Surfaces that point towards the viewer have a positive Z component and display as blue. Other orientations display as some combination of red, green, and blue. \nTangent0&nbsp;\n\nTangents and bitangents are used for rendering normal maps and anisotropic specular.

Tangents are calculated using vertex normals and texture coordinates, so they don't have an intuitive mapping to RGB colors like vertex normals. Looking at a color visualization of tangents may help identify potential problems with normals or normal map rendering such as surfaces appearing inverted or identifying seams. Tangents are not directly editable like vertex positions or texture coordinates. Problems with tangents indicate a problem with the model itself usually due to bad topology, vertex normals, or UV maps. \n","id":"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/vertex_attributes/vertex-attributes/","title":"Vertex Attributes"}},"docInfo":{"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/introduction/":{"body":277,"title":1},"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/materials/":{"body":222,"title":1},"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/materials/hair-materials/":{"body":154,"title":3},"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/materials/material-transitions/":{"body":217,"title":2},"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/materials/model-brightness/":{"body":501,"title":2},"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/materials/renormal/":{"body":127,"title":2},"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/materials/skin-materials/":{"body":213,"title":2},"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/materials/transparency/":{"body":805,"title":1},"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/post_processing/":{"body":198,"title":2},"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/post_processing/colorgradinglut/":{"body":378,"title":3},"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/post_processing/snapshot/":{"body":31,"title":3},"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/renders/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/renders/albedo-recoloring/":{"body":341,"title":2},"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/textures/":{"body":210,"title":1},"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/textures/col/":{"body":250,"title":3},"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/textures/difcube/":{"body":74,"title":3},"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/textures/emi/":{"body":135,"title":3},"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/textures/gamma/":{"body":492,"title":2},"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/textures/nor/":{"body":264,"title":1},"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/textures/prm/":{"body":1029,"title":2},"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/textures/specularcube/":{"body":335,"title":3},"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/vertex_attributes/":{"body":113,"title":2},"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/vertex_attributes/colorsets/":{"body":208,"title":3},"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/vertex_attributes/texturecoordinates/":{"body":219,"title":2},"https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/vertex_attributes/vertex-attributes/":{"body":220,"title":2}},"length":25},"lang":"English"};
